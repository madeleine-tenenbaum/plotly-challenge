# plotly-challenge


I have really struggled with this assignment despite spending a lot of time on it. I tried to break it up but find reading in from the json using d3 really difficult because everything needs to be done in one block. I'm definitely better at breaking these up into smaller parts because I can more easily figure out my mistakes.

I am hoping to get more of this done over the weekend so I can figure out the many mistakes I have made.

I also couldn't get my bar chart axis to treat the y axis data as categories. This was not my week at all!

I'm really disappointed.

At this stage I haven't got to the bubble chart, I'm still struggling with the rest of it. I'm not sure why I'm finding this week so hard. Hoping I will get more done in the next few days.
